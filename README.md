# Nahuel Aparicio Del Blanco

The goal of this project was to create a game similar to Arkanoid using the Visual Studio Console. I expanded on the basic concept, 
adding a ranking system with save functionality and a menu where players can choose between Play, Ranking, and Exit. Players control 
the paddle using A and D to move, with ESC for navigating back in the ranking menu.

Through this project, I gained valuable experience with save systems, game logic, and managing game loops, while also implementing 
additional mechanics beyond the project’s initial requirements.
